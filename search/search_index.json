However, many renderers \u2013 like Github\u2019s and Markdown Here \u2013 support syntax highlighting. Markdown Here supports highlighting for dozens of languages (and not-really-languages, like diffs and HTTP headers); to see the complete list, and how to write the language names, see the highlight.js demo page . Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it. Inline code has back-ticks around it. Blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks ``` , or are indented with four spaces. I recommend only using the fenced code blocks \u2013 they\u2019re easier and only they support syntax highlighting. var s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\"; alert(s); s = \"Python syntax highlighting\" print s No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. But let's throw in a &lt;b&gt;tag&lt;/b&gt;. var s = \"JavaScript syntax highlighting\"; alert(s); s = \"Python syntax highlighting\" print s No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting in Markdown Here (varies on Github).

Tables Tables aren\u2019t part of the core Markdown spec, but they are part of GFM and Markdown Here supports them. They are an easy way of adding tables to your email \u2013 a task that would otherwise require copy-pasting from another application. Colons can be used to align columns. | Tables | Are | Cool | | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:| | col 3 is | right-aligned | $1600 | | col 2 is | centered | $12 | | zebra stripes | are neat | $1 | The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily.

Inline HTML You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it\u2019ll mostly work pretty well. <dl> <dt>Definition list</dt> <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd> <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt> <dd>Does *not* work **very** well.

Horizontal Rule Three or more... --- Hyphens *** Asterisks ___ Underscores Three or more\u2026 Hyphens Asterisks Underscores Line Breaks My basic recommendation for learning how line breaks work is to experiment and discover \u2013 hit <Enter> once (i.e., insert one newline), then hit it twice (i.e., insert two newlines), see what happens. You\u2019ll soon learn to get what you want. \u201cMarkdown Toggle\u201d is your friend. Here are some things to try out: Here's a line for us to start with. This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*. This line is also a separate paragraph, but... This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*. Here\u2019s a line for us to start with.

This line is also begins a separate paragraph, but\u2026 This line is only separated by a single newline, so it\u2019s a separate line in the same paragraph . (Technical note: Markdown Here uses GFM line breaks, so there\u2019s no need to use MD\u2019s two-space line breaks.) YouTube Videos They can\u2019t be added directly but you can add an image with a link to the video like this: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE \" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg\" alt=\"IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" border=\"10\" /></a> Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border: [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE) TeX Mathematical Formulae A full description of TeX math symbols is beyond the scope of this cheatsheet.
